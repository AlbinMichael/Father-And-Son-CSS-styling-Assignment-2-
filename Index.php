      <p>
        It's not time to make a <span class="change">change</span><br>
        Just <span class="relax">relax</span>, take it easy<br>
        You're still <span class="young">young</span>, that's your fault<br>
        There's so much you have to know<br><br>
        Find a <span class="girl">girl</span>, settle down<br>
        If you want, you can <span class="marry">marry</span><br>
        <span class="Line1">Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy</span><br><br>
        I was once like you are now<br>
        And I know that it's not easy<br>
        To be <span class="calm">calm</span> when you've found<br>
        Something going on<br><br>
        But take your <span class="time">time</span>, think a lot<br>
        Why, think of everything you've got<br>
        For you will still be here <span class="tomorrow">tomorrow</span><br>
        <span class="Line2">But your dreams may not</span><br><br>
        How can I try to <span class="explain">explain</span><br>
        When I do, he turns away again<br>
        It's always been the same, <span class="Old">same old story</span><br><br>
        From the moment I could talk,<br>
        I was ordered to <span class="listen">listen</span><br>
        Now there's a way,<br> 
        And I know that I have to <span class="goaway">go away</span><br><br>
        <span class="Line3">I know, I have to go</span><br><br>
        It's not time to make a <span class="change1">change</span><br>
        Just <span class="sitdown">sit down</span>, take it slowly<br>
        You're still <span class="young1">young</span>, that's your fault<br>
        There's so much you have to go through<br><br>
        Find a <span class="girl1">girl</span>, settle down<br>
        If you want, you can <span class="marry1">marry</span><br>
        <span class="Line4">Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy</span><br><br/>
        All the times that I've cried<br>
        Keeping all the things I knew inside<br>
        <span class="ignore">It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it</span><br><br/>
        If they were right, I'd agree<br>
        But it's them they know, not me<br>
        Now there's a way, and I know<br>
        That I have to <span class="goaway1">go away</span><br><br>
        <span class="Line5">I know, I have to go</span>
